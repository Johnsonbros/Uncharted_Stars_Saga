# Prologue - Scene 2: Terra Galactica

The figure sat at a weathered desk, writing in an old journal under dim light. Relics from Earth mixed with advanced technology on the shelves around him—silent reminders of how far they'd traveled. Beyond the windows, Terra Galactica's vast interior lay wrapped in artificial evening, a manufactured dusk that seemed to pause time itself.

He finished the last line and set down his pen. The ink was still wet when voices emerged from somewhere deep within the ship itself.

"There are no alternatives. We proceed as planned." The first voice was flat, mechanical, carrying the weight of absolute certainty.

"The responsibility falls to me now?" The second voice held more warmth, almost questioning, as if hoping for a different answer.

"It always was."

A pause stretched between them, heavy with unspoken consequences. When the second voice spoke again, uncertainty crept through the words.

"If this goes wrong… the cost will be immeasurable."

"Then we ensure it doesn't," the first voice replied with cold finality. "So be it."

The voices faded into the ship's ambient hum. The figure looked down at his journal one last time, reading the words he'd just written: "Today we plant seeds in darkness, not knowing what will grow tomorrow."

He stood slowly and walked to the wide observation window. Terra Galactica spread before him like a living painting—terraced farms cascading down curved walls, bioluminescent trees casting ethereal glows across walkways that connected clusters of homes carved from warm stone. Rivers wound through the artificial landscape, their waters catching the light of a sun that never set.

Above it all, the ship's central spine stretched into the distance, a backbone of steel and purpose that had carried them across the void for generations.

He had seen this view countless times, yet tonight it felt different. Tonight, it felt fragile.

His hands tightened into fists as a chill settled over him. Every glowing tree, every flowing stream, every life within these walls—all of it balanced on the edge of something unknowable. They had built paradise in a bottle, but paradise was delicate. One wrong move, one miscalculation, and their carefully crafted world could shatter like glass.

The darkness beyond the hull pressed against them, vast and patient, filled with possibilities both wonderful and terrible. Tonight, they would invite something new into their sealed world. Tonight, they would discover whether they had opened a door to salvation or damnation.

He felt like a man standing at the edge of a precipice, unable to see what lay below. The weight of decision pressed down on his shoulders—not just his decision, but the decision of his entire species. They were explorers who had ventured too far from shore, and now the tide was coming in.

A shiver ran through him as understanding settled in his bones like winter frost. Every choice had led to this moment. Every calculation, every hope, every fear had brought them to this threshold between what was and what could be.

Tomorrow, their children would wake to a different world. Whether that world would be better or worse, he could not say. He could only hope that when the final accounting was made, they would be remembered as pioneers rather than fools.

The artificial stars dimmed slightly, signaling the ship's transition to night cycle. In the distance, lights began to twinkle in the residential sectors as families settled in for sleep, unaware that their dreams might be the last of their kind.

He closed his eyes and felt the weight of ten thousand souls pressing against his conscience. When he opened them again, his reflection stared back from the darkened glass—a man who had just set the future in motion.

Nothing aboard Terra Galactica would ever be the same.
