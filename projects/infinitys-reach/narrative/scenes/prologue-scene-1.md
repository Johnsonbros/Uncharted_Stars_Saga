# Prologue - Scene 1: The Dark Vessel

In the endless darkness of space, vast emptiness chills even the eternal soul. Stars flicker like lonely candles in the obsidian chapel of the cosmos, each one a feeble protest against the overwhelming void. Here, silence reigns—a profound absence echoing through eternity.

Suddenly, a disruption tears through the eternal night. A solitary traveler cuts across the immense expanse between uncharted stars, moving at velocities that challenge the principles of physics with the audacity of rebellious youth, testing the very limits of possibility.

The craft itself is enigmatic, no larger than ancient Earth weapons built to strike from above. Its exterior is unlike anything terrestrial—as if space itself turned solid, a black so absolute it seems to consume light. Within its compact shell lies cargo that could alter the fate of countless souls.

As the dark harbinger advances, it shreds the fabric of space-time, closing in on something unfathomable. A behemoth emerges from the cosmic night—a gargantuan cylinder floating like a Leviathan in the cold embrace of the black ocean. Stretching incomprehensibly in both length and width, its metallic hull catches only the ghostly pallor of distant stars.

This colossal vessel is wrapped in utter stillness—the hush of dormant mechanisms and reactors that once roared with the energy of a thousand suns. Now they lie silent, as if the great beast has been petrified, a Kraken turned to stone by Medusa's gaze, frozen beneath the starie depths. It awaits, in pregnant silence, the spark that will rouse it from ancient slumber.

As the ebony craft draws nearer, it becomes undeniably clear that its trajectory is no accident, no random crossing of spatial paths. Rather, it moves with the focus and intent of a poison arrow, released from the cosmic bow of fate, aimed straight for the very core of the dormant leviathan. The silence of the void thickens, as if space itself braces for the moment of fatal impact.

In this one fleeting moment, they almost touch, like diverging lines in a Euclidean nightmare—two solitary enigmas passing within an arm's reach in an indifferent universe.

The shadowy vessel skims by the gargantuan cylinder, their proximity a brief whisper in the eternal quiet. Like a wisp of shadow detaching from a darker abyss, it pulls away, distancing itself as it continues into the void's embrace. The space between them stretches, measured not in miles or minutes, but in the vast silence that swallows them both.

Time flows through the universe like stardust—days, maybe weeks—as the shadowy vessel speeds further into the eternity. Then, in the distant blackness, a silent explosion blooms. A sun is born and dies in a single heartbeat, its brief fire slowing the vessel's impossible flight. The craft crawls now, a shadow seeking its destiny.

Eventually, far from prying sensors but still tethered by hidden purpose, the dark vessel adjusts its course. It positions itself within the sleeping Leviathan's path, waiting to be consumed by the great beast.

In response, the titanic structure stirs without waking. Deep within its skeletal frame, ancient protocols whisper to life. A cavernous hangar yawns open—the metallic jaws of the slumbering Kraken, ready to swallow what approaches.

As though hearing a siren's call, the dark craft drifts into the gaping maw, allowing itself to be devoured.

"It has arrived."
